## Introduction

Superdot is a python library for analysing and generating SystemVerilog.

It's basic purpose is to analyse a module and extract the port information.

## Superdot features

Very little functionality exists today but the hope is to add features like

- generate automatic instantiations
- generate testbench templates quickly and easily
- trace and show the module hierarchy.
- generate module instantiations with default inputs/outputs
- Identify packages/includes
- enable batch insertion of include/imports.
